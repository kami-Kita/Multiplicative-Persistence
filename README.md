# Multiplicative-Persistence
Inspired from a numberphile ![video](https://youtu.be/Wim9WJeDTHQ)


__What is it ?__


Given any positive number (n), multiply the all of the digits of the number. Repeat the process until you are left with only 1 digit. We are interested in the *steps* taken by the number (n) to get reduced to a digit.
- example : n = 327
    - step 0 : 327
    - step 1 : 3\*2\*7 = 42
    - step 2 : 4\*2 = 8
            
            
And hence n = 327 takes 2 steps.
Now, we are interested in the *smallest* number that takes a certain given amount of steps. 


__Work done till now__


I've successfully found out the *smallest number* that takes 9 steps using *python*. 


__Future work__


Making the code more efficient and aiming to find out the smallest number for 12 or more steps.
